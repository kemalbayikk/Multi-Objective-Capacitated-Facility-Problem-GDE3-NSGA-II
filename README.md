# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GDE3 AND NSGA-II ALGORITHMS ON MULTI-OBJECTIVE CAPACITATED FACILITY LOCATION PROBLEM

In this project, GDE3 and NSGA-II algorithms are compared by applying them to the Multi Objective Capacitated Facility Location Problem (MOCFLP). In MOCFLP, there are stores and facilities that supply goods to these stores, and these facilities have a certain goods capacity. The purpose of the problem is to determine which facilities will serve which stores in the most optimal way. The parameters tried to be optimized in this report are to minimize the costs of this logistics operation between stores and facilities and the CO2 emissions released during the transportation of goods. The purpose of this report is to compare the performance of GDE3 and NSGA-II algorithms on MOCFLP and find out which algorithm gives better results in terms of hypervolume, runtime and spacing metrics. According to the results obtained, it was determined that the GDE3 algorithm works faster on this problem. However, in most experiments it has been observed that the NSGA-II algorithm achieves more diverse and successful results. The GDE3 algorithm has never been applied to MOCFLP before in the literature, and the findings are important in this respect. At the same time, comparing GDE3 and NSGA-II algorithms together in a complex problem such as MOCFLP provides important information about the performances of the algorithms.
